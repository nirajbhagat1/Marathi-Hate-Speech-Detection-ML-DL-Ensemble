Hate Speech Detection Model

Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning and deep learning project aimed at detecting hate speech in Marathi text. The project leverages both traditional machine learning techniques and advanced deep learning models to provide a robust solution for identifying hate speech in text data.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares Marathi text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and unnecessary whitespace.
Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
Machine Learning Model: Implements Logistic Regression for initial classification and evaluation.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes an LSTM-based model to capture complex patterns and contextual information in the text.
Ensemble Model: Combines both Logistic Regression and LSTM models using an ensemble approach to enhance classification performance.
